# coq_experiments

Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, 
executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of 
machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the certification of properties of programming languages 
(e.g. the CompCert compiler certification project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), 
the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching.
